# How The Web Works? 
Imagine your are browsing and your favorite website pops out! 
Now if you were to understand web, wouldn't you ponder about the way everything combines into an inetractive page which is available to you? (Assuming you did)

Where does this all start?
## Internet
When you first started browsing, the pre-requistes were to be connected to an internet connection via the service you enrolled with your broadband provider. That is **Internet**!

But how does the webpage magically appears in your computer screen? Not until you searched or clicked on the link, right?

A common knowledge would be that if you see things - files, images , videos etc in your device, then it is certainly beacuse your device stores it. But does that mean everything you Google gets stored in your device. Then what about the trillions of data accessible?


**So what happens via Internet?**

Devices accross the globe are connected.That's it.


So when you look for a website on your system, you are viewing data stored in some other computer called **Servers** and internet helps you view it by connecting your device to the data server is making accessible for you. 

### How does Internet Works?
You search in google - via a software, it finds you all relevant websites avaiable in www. All these websites are hosted on servers - super computers running 24*7 that keeps the websites alive for use.

Now what happens is that these servers or lets say everything conncted to internet contains an ip address - unique name for identification.

The websites hosted on servers are mapped in an intenet address book - called domain name system where the domain (.github.com) and the ip address of the server it is running on
are mapped such that it can be easily looked up and fetched for easy viewing in you system!

How this data reaches you from the server is another interesting point. It might be through Wifi in your homes, but for the wifi router, it is connected to the telephone cables which further gets connected to even bigger lines and optic fiber cables. These cables connects continents and are laid undersea that connects the entire world.   

When data reaches your system through these cables, they are converted into packets with a source and destination address and through these lines and cables and rays , lands up to your system.

Magical right?

## The difference between web page, website, web server, and search engine
When you first saw that webpage that got you wondering all sorts of things, that was a **Webpage**. Now once you navigate to another link on the webpage, you see another page - this collection of webpages makes the **Website**.
**Web server** is the computer hosting the website. 
**Search Engine** is a web service that connects us to webpages. It is also running on a web server and responds to requests over internet by fetching data.

### Web Browser
If you ever though google might be a web browser, here's the myth buster- It isn't. The fact you are reading this now, through a web page which you serached through a search engine, you first opened a chrome, safari, edge software - Which is the **Web Broswer**. This is where the webpages load in form of HTML, Js and is available to you!

## Bigger Picture
Life gets easy as when you request a web page through http protocls (Get, Post etc requests) you as a client interact with servers using the same language. This interaction happens successfully when TCP/IP protocols semalessly sends data via cables or wireless medium to web servers situated in other part of the globe.

### Wondering about HTTP Protocols? 
Imagine at a library you ask - "Can I get this book?" , and the librarian says - "Here's the book!" , you get the book!
Now if you searched for say github and the web service (search engine) fetching your webpage would ask the server - "Can I get this web page?" , and your server would reply -"HTTP Status OK" , "HTTP Status Not Found" etc. 

This language is the protocol, the **HTTP protocol** - language to communicate with servers as a client . **What's a Client?** Any entity—typically a device, application, or user—that initiates a request over a network to consume services or solutions provided by another party.
