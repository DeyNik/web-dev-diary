# Setting Up the Development System
I'm a native Windows User. Although, Powershell commands come handy, beyond the basic syntax, it always feel like a complicated world.

I have witnessed Pro coders use linux quite often to carry their day to day work. In reality, this not only impacts overall performance, but make things more accessible. Still unbelievable, but worth a shot!

## Windows Setup
Using Linux in Windows is about using either of the three:
1. A VirtualBox Virtual Machine
2. Dual-boot Ubuntu installation
3. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)

While installing WSL is straight forward and the easiest, the other options have sizeable audience.

**Virtual Machine** refers to an emulation of Computer that runs within your OS but can run with the same or different OS. While the machine is restricted to access all the resources on your computer, it provides a starightforward way to strat quickly. 

**Dual Booting** refers to installation of 2 different OS in your system with the option to boot any one you desire. While the OS would have full acess to your device's resources, it comes with its own risks and advantages.
